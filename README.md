# 🧮 C Lab: Spreadsheet Program

Welcome to the C Lab assignment for COP290! 🎓 This project is all about building an interactive spreadsheet program with some amazing features. 💡

## Features 🚀
- Supports direct and formula-based cell value assignments (like `A1=5`, `B1=A1+2`).
- Scrollable sheet with commands (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`) for large spreadsheets.
- Handy functions like `MAX`, `MIN`, `SUM`, and `SLEEP` for calculations.
- Error handling for invalid commands, circular dependencies, and division by zero.

## How to Run 🛠️
1. Run `make` to compile the program.
2. Start with `./sheet R C` (where R and C define the number of rows and columns).
3. Use commands like `A1=2`, `B1=A1+3`, or `q` to exit.

## Cool Commands 🎯
- `disable_output`: Suppresses the display of outputs.
- `enable_output`: Re-enables outputs.
- `scroll_to <CELL>`: Directly scroll to a specific cell.

Happy coding and debugging! 🎉✨
